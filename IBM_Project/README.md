2. Navigating the Website:

Use the website's navigation menu or links to browse different pages and sections.
Click on menu items, buttons, or links to access specific content or pages.

4. Accessing the Content Management System (CMS):

Many websites are built on CMS platforms like WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal. Access the CMS by going to a specific URL or login page, often located at https://manivel9655.github.io/CAD_NM_Project/ (for WordPress).
5. Update Content:

Once logged in to the CMS, you can usually access the content you want to update through the following steps:
a. Pages or Posts: Websites often have a "Pages" or "Posts" section where you can find and edit existing content. Click on the title of the page or post you want to modify.
b. Media Library: For images, videos, and files, there's usually a "Media Library" where you can upload, replace, or delete media files.

d. Widgets or Blocks: In some CMSs, you can customize the website's layout by adding, editing, or removing widgets or blocks.
6. Edit Content:

After you access the specific content you want to edit, use the CMS's built-in editor to make changes. This editor typically resembles a word processing software, allowing you to modify text, add images, and format content.

Backup: Before making significant changes, it's a good practice to create a backup of your website or content, especially if you're unfamiliar with the CMS.
Permissions: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access rights to edit content on the website.
Version Control: For more complex websites, you may want to implement version control systems like Git to track changes and collaborate with a team.
SEO Considerations: If you're updating content for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes, be aware of how changes can impact your website's search rankings.
